# Welcome to my blog

I'm glad you are here. I plan to talk about my journey in becoming a software developer. 
:heart:

Few years ago, i decided to be a sofware developer but was unsure about how to start.

So, i applied for a bootcamp. I got into *Decagon* located in **Lagos, Nigeria.**

*stick with me for this exciting journey*
